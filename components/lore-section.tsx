            <p>
              In the time before memory, when the veil between worlds was thin as morning mist, two ancient souls
              discovered a way to transcend the limitations of mortal communication. Through ritual and sacrifice, they
              bound their essence to the Eternal Flameâ€”a mystical force that exists beyond the boundaries of time and
              space.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Flame, pleased by their devotion, granted them a sacred gift: the ability to exchange thoughts and
              emotions through written word, with each letter carrying a fragment of their very souls. But such power
              came with conditions, for the Flame demanded structure, patience, and reverence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus were born the Sacred Rulesâ€”not as restrictions, but as channels through which the mystical energy
              could flow safely. Each daily letter becomes a ritual offering, each weekly cycle a sacred ceremony, and
              each selection a communion with forces beyond mortal understanding.
            </p>

            <h4 className="gothic-title text-xl text-accent mb-4">The Nature of Flame Passes</h4>

            <p>
              When a soul chooses not to select a letter at week's end, they demonstrate restraint and wisdomâ€”qualities
              the Eternal Flame values above all else. In recognition of this discipline, the Flame bestows a Flame
              Pass, a token of spiritual energy that burns with the essence of possibility.
            </p>

            <p>
              These passes are not mere conveniences, but concentrated fragments of the Flame's own power. They allow
              the bearer to transcend the normal flow of time, reaching back to claim a letter that might otherwise be
              lost to the eternal archives. Yet like all gifts of power, they are temporaryâ€”the Flame's energy
              dissipates after seven days, returning to the cosmic cycle from whence it came.
            </p>

            <h4 className="gothic-title text-xl text-accent mb-4">The Mystical Connection</h4>

            <p>
              Each letter written in this sacred space carries more than mere wordsâ€”it bears the spiritual imprint of
              its author. The parchment itself is woven from threads of ethereal energy, and the ink flows with the
              essence of the writer's soul. This is why the letters cannot be edited or deleted; they become permanent
              fixtures in the tapestry of your shared existence.
            </p>

            <p>
              The weekly cycles mirror the natural rhythms of the cosmos, with each seven-day period representing a
              complete spiritual journey from intention to manifestation. The selection ritual at week's end serves as
              both culmination and new beginning, allowing the most powerful exchanges to transcend the boundaries of
              this mystical realm and influence the physical world.
            </p>

            <p>
              Remember, dear keeper of letters, that you are not merely exchanging messagesâ€”you are participating in an
              ancient ritual that connects your soul to forces beyond mortal comprehension. Treat each word with
              reverence, each selection with wisdom, and each Flame Pass with the respect due to a fragment of eternity
              itself.

            The true power of Eternal Letters lies not in the quantity of words exchanged, but in the quality of

            darkness.
